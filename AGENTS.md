# Agent Instructions

This repository contains the Typed BEM Class Generator, a utility for generating type-safe BEM class names with TypeScript.

## Key Rules for Agents

- **README Synchronization**: The German README file (`README.de.md`) must always be a 1:1 translation of the English README file (`README.md`).
  - If changes are made to the English README, ensure the German README is updated accordingly.
  - Use consistent formatting and structure in both files to maintain alignment.
- **Code Formatting**: Always run `pnpm format -w` to ensure consistent code formatting.
- **Linting**: Use `pnpm lint` to check for and fix any linting issues before committing changes.
- **Testing**: Run `pnpm test` to ensure all tests pass after making changes.

## Development Guidelines

- **TypeScript First**: All code must be written in TypeScript to ensure type safety and maintainability.
- **Commit Messages**: Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) specification for clear and structured commit messages.
- **Documentation Updates**: Ensure that any changes to the library are reflected in both the English and German README files.

## Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting a pull request, ensure the following:

1. All code changes are formatted and linted.
2. Tests have been updated and pass successfully.
3. Documentation is updated, including both README files.
4. Commit messages follow the Conventional Commits specification.
